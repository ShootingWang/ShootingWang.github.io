# Are All of Your Memories Real?

In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost in a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories in ~~living~~ **vivid** detail, one even remembered that the old man ~~resecured~~ **rescued** him ~~with~~ **was** wearing a **flannel**（法兰绒） shirt. 

But ~~neither~~ **none of** these people had actually ~~got~~ **gotten** lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the ~~psychologies~~ **psychologists** ~~conducted~~ **conducting** ~~this~~ **the** study told them they**'d** gotten lost, and **although** ~~that~~ they might not remember the incident, their parents ~~have~~ **had** confirmed it. And it wasn't just one or two people who thought they remembered getting lost——a quarter of the participants did. 

~~This~~ **These** finding**s** may sound~~s~~ unbelievable, but they actually reflect a very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unrealiable. And **though** we still don't know **precisely** ~~we called ability~~ **what causes this fallibility**（易错，不可靠） on **a neurological**（神经学的，神经病学的） level. ~~Researcher~~ **Research** has highlighted **some of** the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. 

The mall study highlights how we can inco**rporate** information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal ~~regnition~~ **recollections**（回忆，追忆；往事，回忆录） withour realising it. This kind of ~~subjectn ability~~ **suggestibility**（可教唆；可建议；被暗示性） is just one influence ~~in~~ our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly show**ed** a random collection~~s~~ of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus none of them had ever visited ~~it~~. When ~~showing~~ **shown** ~~these~~ **the** images three weeks later, a majority of participants said that they ~~have~~ **had** probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. 

The participants ~~mistributed~~ **misattributed** information from one ~~contest~~ **context**, an image they**'d** seen, ~~on to~~ **onto**（表示“本体，存在”之义） another, **a** memory of something they believed ~~and~~ **they** actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown an image of ~~an~~ **a** magni**fying** glass, and then told them to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw ~~an magni~~ **the magnifying** glass and the lollipop. They ~~straggly~~ **struggled** to ~~connect~~ **link** the objects to the correct **context** whether they actually saw them, or simply imagined them.

Another study where **a** ~~psychologies~~ **psychologist** ~~inquired~~ **questioned** over 2,000 people on their views about the legal**ization** of **marijuana**（大麻） , highlights **yet** ~~the~~ another kind of influence ~~way of memories~~ **on memory**. Participants answered ~~the question~~ **questions** in 1973 and 1982. Those who said they ~~have~~ supported the ~~legal~~ **marijuana legalization**  in 1973, but reported they were against in 1982, were more likely **to** recall~~ed~~ **that** they were actually against legalization in 1973, bringing their old views in ~~one~~ **line** with their curent ones. Our current opinions, feelings and experiences can bias our memories of how we ~~feeled~~ **felt** in the past.

In another study, researchers gave two groups of participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate the likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information except **that** they only told one group who had actually won the war, the other group didn't know the real ~~war's~~ **world** outcome. In theory, both groups' answers should be similar, because the likelihood of each side winning isn't affected by who actually won. If there is **a** 20% **chance of** thunderstorms and **a** thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms doesn't **retroactively**（逆动地；追溯地） go up to 100%. Still, the group ~~they~~ **that** knew how the war ended rated the winning side ~~has~~ **as** more likey to win ~~and~~ **than the** group did not. 

All of ~~the ability~~ **these fallibilities of memory** can have real-world ~~in past~~ **impacts**. If ~~the~~ police ~~interegation~~ **interrogations**（讯问） **use leading** questions with eye witnesses or suspects, ~~suggest ability~~ **suggestibility** could result in incorrect identifications or unreliable ~~confections~~ **confessions**（自首；供认；忏悔）. Even in the abscence of **leading** questions（引导性问题）, **misattribution** can ~~leading~~ **lead to inaccurate** eyewitness **testimony**（证词；证明，证据）. In a courtroom, if **a** judge **rules** a piece of **evidenct inadmissible**（不能允许的，不可接受的） and **tells jurors**（审查委员，陪审员）  to disregard it, they may not be able to do so. In a medical **setting**, if ~~patients~~ **a patient seeks a** second ~~position~~ **opinion and the second physician** is ~~well~~ **aware of the** first one**'s** ~~diagnose~~ **diagnosis**, that knowledge may bias their conclusion.

Our memories are not **ironclad**（装甲的；坚固的；装甲舰） ~~by~~ **representations of reality**, ~~an~~ but subjective perseptions. And ~~it's~~ **there is** not ~~necessary~~ **necessarily anything** wrong with that, the problem**s arise** ~~is~~ when we treat memory as fact, rather than ascepting ~~on the mental~~ **this fundamental** truth about the nature of **our recollections**.
