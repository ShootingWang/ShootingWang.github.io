# How to Outsmart the Prisoner's Dilemma
- [How to Outsmart the Prisoner's Dilemma](https://www.ted.com/talks/lucas_husted_how_to_outsmart_the_prisoner_s_dilemma/transcript#t-7138)
- 2020.09.02

Two perfectly rational **gingerbread**(姜饼) men, Crispy and Chewy, are out **strolling** when they caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, he decides that, instead **of** simply eating them, he**'ll** put their friendship ~~into~~ **to the** ~~a~~ test with a cruel dilemma. He**'ll** ask~~s~~ each **gingerbread** man whether he**'d opt** ~~ask~~ to spare or scarifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know that the other chose until their decisions are locked in.

If both choose to spare the other, the fox will eat just one of each of their legs. If one choose**s** to spare while the other sacrifices, the sparer will fully eaten while the **traitor** will run away with all his limbs ~~intack~~ **intact**(完整的). Finally, if both choose to scarifice, ~~then~~ the fox will eat three limbs from each. 

In game theory, the scenario is called Prisoner's Dilemma. To figure out how these **gingerbread men will** act their perfect ~~way~~ **rationality**, we can map ~~these~~ **the** outcomes of each decision. The rows represents Crispy's choices, **and** the columns are Chewys'. Meanwhile, the number**s** in each cell represent~~s~~ outcomes of their decisions, as measured in the number of limbs each ~~will~~ **would** keep. So, do we expect their friendship to last the game?

First, let's consider Chewy's options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run away ~~scar free~~ **scot-free** by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy ~~sacrificing~~ **scacrifes** him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs if he also scarifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome by choosing **to** sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. 

This is the standard conclusion of **the** Prisoner's Dilemma: the **two characters** will betray one the other. Their strategy to **unconditionally** scarifice their companion is what game ~~theory~~ **theorists** called the Nash Equilibrium, meaning that neither can gain by deviating from it. 

Crispy and Chewy act accordingly, and the ~~smart~~ **smug**(沾沾自喜的，自满的) fox runs off **with a belly full of gingerbread,** ~~the~~ leaving the two former friends with just one leg to stand ~~off~~ **on**.

Normally, this is where the story would end, but a wizard(巫师) happen**ed** to **be** watch**ing** the whold **mess** unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy **that**, as punishment for betray**ing** each other, they**'re doomed** to repeat this dilemma for the rest of their lives, starting with all ~~full~~ **four** limbs at each sunrise. Now what happens?

This called ~~the~~ **an** Infinite Prisoner's Dilemma. And it is a ~~little~~ **literal game changer** , that**'s** because ~~of~~ the **gingerbread** men  **can** now use their future decisions as bargaining **chips** ~~chess~~ for the present **ones** ~~points~~. Consider this strategy: both agree to spare each other everyday. If one **ever** chooses to scarifice, the other will **retaliate** ~~entirely eat~~ by **choosing** ~~the~~ scarifice~~r~~ for the rest of ~~the~~ **eternity**(来世，来生) . So is that enough to get ~~this~~ **these** poor **sentient**(有意识的，有感情的) goods to agree to cooperate?

To figure that out, we have to **factor in** another consideration: the **gingerbread** men probably care about the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future limbs by some number~~s~~, which we'll call delta. This is similiar to the idea of inflation ~~you rolling you of your~~ **eroding the value of** money. If delta is one half, on day 1, they care about day 2 limbs half as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs one quarter as much as day 1 limbs, and so on. 

A delta of zero means **that** they don't care about their future limbs at all, so ~~that would~~ **they'll** repeat their initial choice~~s~~ of mutual scarifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, they'll do anything possible to avoid **the** pain of infinite trible limbs consumption, which means they will choose to spare each other. At some point in between, they would go either way. We can find out where that point is by ~~write~~ **writing** the ~~theory~~ **infinite series that** represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other and solve for delta. 

That ~~is~~ **yields** one third, meaning that **as long as** Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at leat one third as much as today, **it's** ~~is~~ optimal for them to spare and cooperate forever.

This analysis isn't **unique** to cookies and wizards, you see it play out in real-life situations, like trade negotiations **and** international politics. Rational leader**s** must assume~~d,~~ **that** the decision**s** they make today will impact those **of their adversaries** ~~they~~  tomorrow. ~~Scarifice~~ **Selfishness** may ~~be for~~ **win out in the short-term** ~~shorten~~, but with ~~probable incentence~~ **with the proper incentives**, **peaceful** cooperation is not only possible but **demonstrably** and mathematical**ly** idea**l**. 

As for the **gingerbread** men, ~~they will~~ **their eternity** maybe pretty **crumby,** but **so long as** they go out on a limb, their friendship will never again be half-baked.

# Why I Love Vultures
- [Why I love vultures](https://www.ted.com/talks/munir_virani_why_i_love_vultures)
- 2021.05.10

I would like to talk to you about a very special group pf animals. 

There are ten thousand~~s of~~ species of birds in the world. Vultures are ~~amounts of~~ **amongst** the most ~~strengthen~~ **threatened** group ~~in the~~ **of** birds . When you see a vulture like this, the first thing that comes to **your** mind is, ~~this is a~~ **these are** disgusting, ugly, greedy creature**s** that **are just** after your flesh, associated with politicians.

I want to change that perception. I want to change those feelings you have for ~~this~~ **these** bird**s**, because they need our sympathy. They really do. And I will tell you why.

First of all, why ~~did~~ **do** they have such a bad press? When Charles Darwin went **a**cross **the Atlantic** in 1872 on the **Beagle**（贝格尔号）, he saw the Turkey vulture, and he said, “These **are** disgusting birds with ~~balt~~ **bald**（秃的） scarlet（猩红色，绯红色） heads **that are** formed to **revel**（狂欢，陶醉） in **putridity**（腐败）. You ~~can~~ **could** not get **a** worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. You know, he changed his mind when he came back, and I tell you why. They**'ve** also ~~been~~ **be** associated with Disney, **personified as** ~~with~~ groofy（古怪的）, **dumb**, stupid characters. 

More recently, if you**'ve been** following the Kenyan Press. These are **the** attribute**s** that they associated ~~with~~ **the** Kenyan **MPs with** ~~and~~. But I want to challenge that. Do you know why? Because **MPs** do not keep the environment clean. **MPs** do not help **to** prevent **the** spread of diseases. They are hardly **monogamous**（一夫一妻）. They are far from **being** extinct. And my favorite is, vultures are better looking.

So, there ~~are still~~ **is** two ~~kinds~~ **types** of vulture in this planet. There are New World vultures that are ~~many~~ **mainly** found in Americas, like **the condors** and **the caracaras**, **and then** ~~In~~ the Old World vultures, where we have 16 species, from ~~the~~ **these** 16, 11 of them are facing a high risk **of** extinction. 

So why are vultures important?  First of all, they provide vital ecological **services**. They clean up, they are our nature garbage collectors. They clean up **carcasses**（动物尸体；烹饪过的禽鸟骨骼） right to the bone. They help to kill all **the** ~~bactery~~ **bacteria**（细菌）. They help absorb **anthrax**（炭疽） **that would** otherwise spread and cause huge **livestock**（家畜，牲畜） ~~stop~~ losses and diseases ~~for~~ **in other** animals. Recent~~ly study~~ **studies have** ~~has~~ shown that ~~the~~ **in** area**s where there are** ~~with~~ no vultures, **carcasses** ~~has to~~ take up **to** three to four times to ~~be~~ decompose~~d~~, and this has huge **ramifications**（结果，后果） for the spread of diseases.

Vultures also have **tremendous**（巨大的，惊人的） historical significance. They ~~are~~ **have been** associated with ancient Egypt**ian** culture. **Nekhbet**（奈赫贝特，上埃及守护神） was ~~a~~ **the** symbol of **the** protector and the motherhood, and together with the **cobra**（眼镜蛇）, symbolize**d** the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. In ~~India~~ **Hindu**（印度教的，印度的；印度人，印度教教徒） mythology（深化）, **Jatayu** was ~~a~~ **the** vulture god, and he ~~raise~~ **risked** his life in order to save the god**ness** ~~tan~~ **Sita** from 10**-headed** demon **Ravana**（罗波那，是印度史诗罗摩衍那中登场的反派，名字带有「以暴力让人痛泣」的含意）. In Tibet**an**（西藏的，藏族人的；藏文的，藏语的；西藏人，藏族人；藏文，藏语） culture, they are perfoming very important sky burial**s**. In places like Tibet, ~~that~~ there are no places to bury ~~to death~~ **the dead**, or **wood** to **cremate**（火葬，烧成灰） **them**, so these vultures to provide a natural **disposal** system.

So what is problem with vultures? We have 8 species **of** vultures **that occur** in Kenya, ~~for~~ **of** which 6 are highly threatened with extinction. The reason is **that** they are getting poisoned. And the reason that they are getting poisoned is because ~~the~~ **there's** human-wild life conflict**s**. The **pastoral**（农村生活的；牧师的；宜于放牧的） communities are using this poison to target the **predators**（食肉动物；掠夺者；捕食者）, and **in** return, **the** vultures are falling to victim to ~~death~~. 

In South Asia, **in** countries like India and Pakistan, 4 species of vultures are listed ~~to~~ **as** critical**ly** ~~in danger~~ **endangered**, which means they have less than 10 and 15 years to **go** extinct. **And** the reason is because they are falling ~~in~~ prey by consuming ~~life~~ **livestock that has been treated** with **a painkilling** ~~pain~~ drug~~s~~ like **Diclofenac**（双氯芬酸）. ~~These~~ **This** drug~~s~~ **has** now been banned for **veterinary**（兽医的） use in India, and they **have taken a** stand. Because there are no vultures, there ~~are~~ **is been a** spread ~~a~~ **in the** number**s** of **feral**（野生的；凶猛的；阴郁的） dogs **at carcass dump site** ~~are size~~, and when you have **feral** dogs, you have a huge time bomb of **rabies**（狂犬病；恐水症）. The number of cases of **rabies** has increased **tremendously**（极大地；极端地；极其；非常） in India. 

Kenya is going to have one of the ~~most~~ **largest** wind farms in Afica, 353 wind **turbines**（涡轮；涡轮机） are **going to be up at Lake Turkana** . I am not against wind energy, but we need to **work with the** governments, because wind **turbines do this to birds**. **They slice** ~~slicing~~ them to half. They are bird**-blending** machines（搅拌机）. In West Africa, there ~~are~~ **a horrific** trade~~s~~ of ~~death~~ **dead** vultures to serve the **witchcraft**（巫术；魔法） ~~wizerd~~ and **the fetish**（迷信；偶像；恋物） market. 

So what's being done? **Well,** we are conducting research~~s~~ on these birds. We are putting **transmitters**（传送者；传达者；发射机；发报机） on them, we **are** try**ing** to determine ~~the~~ **their** basic ecology, and see where they go. We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a **problem** locally,  **it** is not ~~gonna~~ **going to** help you. We need to **work with** government**s** in **regional** levels. We are working with local communities, we are talking to them about **appreciating vultures,** ~~the~~ about the need from with**in to** ~~them, we~~ appreciate these wonderful creatures and **the services that** they provide.

How can you help? You can become active, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these **these** misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time to spread the word~~s~~. Spread the word~~s~~. When you walk out **of** this room, you will be **informed** about vultures, **but** speak to you families, to your children, to your neighbors about vultures. 

They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said, he changed his mind because he watched them fly **effortlessly**（轻松地；豪不费劲地） without energy in the sky. Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species. Thank you very much.

**Mastering**（掌握） **any** physical skill, **be it** performing a ~~pillow wape~~ **pirouette**（脚尖点地的旋转）, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice. Pratice is a repetition of an action with ~~a~~ **the** goal of improvement and **it** helps us perform more ease, speed and confidence. So what is practice do in our brains to make us better ~~in our~~ **at** things?

Our brains has two kinds of ~~neuro~~ **neural** tissue（组织）, gray matter and white matter. The gray matter processes information in the brain, directing signals and **sensory stimuli**（刺激；刺激物；促进因素） to nerve cells. While white matter is mostly made up of fatty tissue and nerve ~~vibes~~ **fibers**（纤维；光纤）. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from the brain's grey matter, down ~~to~~ the ~~vibes~~ **spinal**（脊骨的；脊髓的；脊柱的） **cord**（束缚；绳索） , through ~~channel~~ **a chain** of **nerve fibers** called **axons** to our muscles. 

So how ~~these~~ **does** practice ~~of~~ **or** repetition affect the inner working of our brains? The axons **that** exist in ~~our~~ **the** white matter **are wrapped with a fatty substance** ~~by a~~ called ~~myellien~~ **myelin**（髓磷脂；myeline）. And **it's this myelin** covering, or **sheath**（鞘）, ~~they~~ **that** seems to change with practice. ~~Myellien~~ **Myelin is similar to insulation**（隔离，隔绝） **on electrical cables**（电缆；钢索）. It prevents energy loss **from electrical signals that** ~~for~~ the ~~that~~ brain uses, **moving** them **more** effeciently **along neural pathways**. Some recent studies **in mice** suggest **that the repetition of a** physical motion increases the layers of ~~mylliens~~ **myelin sheath** ~~shift~~ that **insulates the** axons. And **the** more layers, the greater **the insulation** around the axon **chain**, forming **a sort of** ~~the~~ superhighway（信息高速公路） for information connecting your brain to ~~the~~ **your** muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes to the muscle~~'s~~ memory. Muscles themselves don't really have memory. Rather, it may be the **myelination** of neuro pathways~~, they~~ **that** give**s** these athletes and performers their ~~age~~ **edge** ~~to~~ **with** faster and more efficient ~~nerve~~ **neural** pathways.

There are many theories that **attempt** ~~deter~~ to quantify **the number of hours** ~~our years~~, days, and even years **of** practice that it takes to **master a** skill~~s~~. While we don't yet have ~~the~~ **a** magic number, we do know **that mastery** isn't simply about the amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effect**tive**ness of that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focus**ed**, and targets content **or** weaknesses that **lie** at the ~~age~~ **edge** of one**'s current** abilities.

So if effective practice is the key, how can we get **the** most of our practice time? Try these tips. Focus on the tasks at hand. Mini**mi**ze **potential distractions** ~~the diste of practice~~ by turning off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone on airplane mode.

In one study, researchers obeserved 260 students study**ing** ~~in~~. On average, those students ~~was~~ **were** able **to stay** ~~stand~~ on task for only 6 minutes at a time. Laptops, smart phones, and particularly Facebook, were the **root of most distractions**. 

Start ~~at~~ **out** slowly or in slow-motion. **Coordination** is built with repetitions, whether correct or incorrect. If you gradually increase the speed ~~and~~ **of the** quality ~~of~~ repetitions, you have **a** better chance **of doing** ~~to do~~ them correctly. Next, **frequent** repetition**s** with ~~a lot of~~ **allotted breaks are common practice habits of elite** performers . Studies have shown **that** many top athletes, musicians and dancers ~~spent~~ **spend** 50 to 60 hours per week on ~~activity~~ **activities** related to their craft. Many divide their time use**d for** ~~to~~ effective~~ly~~ practice into **multiple** daily practice ~~section~~ **sessions** of limit**ed duration** .And finally, practice in your brain in **vivid** detail, it is a ~~big~~ **bit** surprising, but a number of studies suggest that once **a** physical motion has been established, it can be reinforced just by ~~imagine~~ **imagining it**. In one study, 144 basketball players ~~was~~ **were** divided into two groups. Group A physically practice one-hand**ed free throws** while group B only mentally practice**d** them. When they were tested at the end of **the** two week~~s~~ experiment, **the intermediate**（中间的；中级的） and **experienced** players in both groups ~~have~~ **had** improved by nearly the same amount.

As scientists get closer to **unraveling the** secrets of our brain**s**, our understanding of effective~~ly~~ practice will only improve~~d~~. In the meantime, effective~~ly~~ practice is the best way we have of push**ing** our individual limits, achiving ~~a~~ new ~~hight~~ **heights**, and **maximizing** our **potential**.
