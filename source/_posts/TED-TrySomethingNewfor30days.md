# 初衷
2020年05月18日，做了个重要的决定，解决了一个困扰了我许久的问题，虽然转而需要在有限的时间里完成一个重要又艰巨的任务，但是我很欣慰自己做出的改变。

2020年05月18日晚上，久违地点开邮箱里的TED Recommends，听了一个TED演讲，萌生了一个念头——养成听TED演讲的习惯。

但我很可能又只是一时脑热，没坚持几天就又停止了。

于是乎，想到了一个能扩宽视野+能提高英语水平+能督促自我的方式——听写。

<center>听写TED</center>

该系列就诞生啦~

初步设定：
- 尽量做到每周完整听完2~3个TED视频
- listen and write down all I recognised
- check out with subtitles
- ~~删除线~~删除错误的词句，**粗体**补充遗漏的词句

A few years ago, I ~~thought~~ **felt** that I was stuck ~~and rot~~ **in a rut**, so I decided to follow ~~some steps~~ **in the footsteps of the great** ~~Great an~~  Ameriacan ~~fellow~~ **philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and** try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something ~~you~~ **you've** always ~~want~~ **wanted** to **add to** your life and try **it** for the next 30 days. It turns out, 30 day is just about **the right amount of time** to add ~~your~~ **a new** habit or substract ~~your~~ **a** habit **--** like watching the news **--** from your life.

There is **a** few thing**s** that I learned **while doing thest** ~~from~~ 30-day challenges. **The first** ~~First~~ was, instead **of the months** ~~month~~ flying by**,** forgotten, the time ~~is~~ **was** much more ~~mememble~~**memorable**. This **was** part of **a** challenge I **did to** take pictures every day for a month~~,~~**.** and I remember exactly where I was and what was I doing that day. I also notice**d**~~,~~ that **as** I **started to do** more and harder 30 **-**day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I went **rom desk-dwelling** ~~to dual desk~~ computer ~~room too,~~ **nerd to** the kind **of guy who** bike**s** to work for fun.

Even last year, I~~'d piking mountain~~ **ended up hikiing up Mt.Kilianjaro,** the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventure**s** before **I started** my 30 **-**day challenges.
I also figure**ed** out that if you really want something ~~mad~~ **badly** enough, you can do anything for 30 days. ~~If~~ **Have** you **ever** want**ed** to write a novel
~~,~~ **?** every November **,** tens of thousands of people try to write **their own** ~~a~~ 50,000 **-** word novel **,** from ~~Scritch~~ **scratch,** in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write ~~1,600 and 60 more~~ **1,667 words** a day for a month. So I did, by the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you **'ve** written your ~~work~~ **words for the** ~~this~~ day. You might be ~~sleepy bread~~ **sleep-deprived**, but you**'ll** finish~~ed a~~ **your** novel.

Now, it's my book the next great American novel? Nooooo, I wrote it in a month, it's awful.
But, for the rest of my life, if I meet John **Hodgman** ~~in a tech~~ **at a TED** party, I don't have to say &lsquo;I'am a computer scientist', no, no, if I want to, I can say, 'I'am a novelist'.

So here is one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned **that** when I ~~make~~ **made** small sustainable changes, things I ~~can~~ **could** keep doing, they ~~would~~ **were** more likely ~~sticked~~ **to stick**. There is nothing wrong with **big,** crazy challenges **.In** ~~and~~ fact, they are **a ton of fun.**~~,~~ but they **'re less** likely to stick~~ed~~. When I ~~give~~ **gave** up sugar for 30 days, ~~then~~ **day** 31 ~~looks~~ **looked** like this (picture).

So here is my question to you, what are you waiting for? I gurantee to you the next 30 days are going to pass ~~when you and I get~~ **whether you like it or** not. So why not think about something you have always want**ed** to try and ~~get to finish it~~ **give it a shot** for the next 30 days.
Thanks.

# 2nd - Lies, damned lies and statistics
- [Lies, damned lies and statistics](https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_wernicke_lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks)

If you go on the TED website, you can currently find there over a full week of TED talk videos, over 1.3 million words of transcript**s** and millions of **user** ratings. And that**'s** ~~was~~ huge ~~managed~~ **amount of** data and **it** got me wondering, if **you** took all ~~these~~ **this** data and put it through ~~the~~ statistical analysis, could you reverse engineer a TED talk, could you create the **ultimate** TED talk, and also, could you create the ~~worse~~ **worst** possible TED talk that ~~I~~ **they would still let** ~~get~~ you **get** away with.

To find this out, I looked at three things. I looked at the topic, that ~~it~~ **you** should ~~truth~~ **choose, I looked at** how ~~it~~ **you** should ~~deliberately~~ **deliver it and the visuals onstage** ~~the videos on stage~~. Now, with ~~a~~ **the** topic **: there is a** ~~at the~~ whole range of the topics you can choose, but you should choose wisely, because ~~if~~ your topic strongly ~~correlated~~ **correlates** with how users **will** react~ed~ to ~~the~~ **your** talk. Now, to make this more ~~concreat~~ **concrete**, let's look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick~~ed~~ out ~~and~~ **in the** most favorite TED talks and **in** the least favorite TED talks. So if you came here to talk about how French coffee **will** spread~~s~~ happiness in ~~your~~ **our** brain**s**, that's a ~~goal~~ **go**! Whereas, if you want**ed** to talk about your project involving oxygen, girls, aircraft, ~~and ~~ actually I ~~will~~ **would like to** hear that talk, but statistics say~~s~~ it is not **so** good.

If you ~~generalise~~ **generalize** this**,** the most favorite TED talks **those** that feature topic**s** can **conn**net with**,** both easily and deeply, such as~~,~~ happiness,our own body, food and emotions, and the more technical topics such as architecture, materials and strange**ly** enough, men **, those** are not good topics to talk about.

How should you ~~deliberate~~ **deliver** your talk**?** ~~and~~ TED ~~it~~ is famous for keeping a very ~~short~~ **sharp** eye on the clock, so there're going to hate me for revealing this, because actually you should talk as long as they ~~would~~ **let** let you, because the most favorite TED talks are on average ~~are~~ **over** ~~15%~~ **50 percent** longer than the least favorite ones. And ~~it is~~ **this holds** true for all ranking **lists** on TED **.com** ~~talks come~~ except if you want to have a talk that is beautiful, inspiring ~~and~~ **or** funny then you should **be brief** ~~breath~~, ~~and after~~ **But other than** that, talk~~s~~ until they drag you off ~~this~~ **the** stage.

# 3rd - What is depression?

Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world. In the United States, ~~cause~~ **close** 10 percent of ~~dogs~~ **adults** struggl~~ed~~ with depression. But ~~the of~~ **because it's a** mental illness **,** it can be ~~lard~~ **a lot harder** to understand **than**,~~and said~~ **say**, **high cholesterol**(胆固醇).

One major ~~sauce~~ **source** of confusion is the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down from time to time~~,~~ **G**etting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even the rainy day can bring on feeling of sadness. Sometimes there was not trigger at all, it just ~~pass about~~ **pops up out of the** blue, then ~~circustance~~ **circumstances** change~~d~~, **and** those sad feeling**s** disappeared.

Clinical depression is different, it is medical disorder, and it won't go away just because you want it to. It ~~rankered to~~ **lingers for at least** two ~~and~~ **consecutive** weeks and significantly ~~enters~~ **interferes with one's** ~~your feels with~~ ability to work, play or love.

Depression can have a lot of different symptoms, ~~alone~~ **a low** mood, ~~lots~~ **loss** of interest~~ing~~ **in** things you**'d normally** ~~no more~~ enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or **excessively** guilty, sleeping ~~at~~ **either** too much or too little, poor concentration, rest**less**ness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least 5 of those symptoms, according to **psychiatric**（精神病学的） guideline**s**, you ~~qualified~~ **qualify** for a diagnose of depression. 

And it**'s not** just ~~not behaviored your~~ **behavioral** symptoms, depression has physical manifestation**s** inside the brain. First of all, ~~they wolud~~ **there are** change**s** ~~as they would~~ **that could** be seen ~~in~~ **with** the naked eyes in X.Ray vision**.** ~~,~~ **There include** small**er** frontal lobe**s**（耳垂；脑叶） and ~~hippocampus~~ **hippocampal**（海马趾的） ~~volumn~~ **volumes**. On a more microscale, depression is **associated** with **a** few things, the abnormal ~~transmition~~ **transmission** or **depletion（消耗;用尽） of certain neurotransmitters（神经传递素）,** especially serotonin（血清素）, norepinephrine（降肾上腺素,去甲肾上腺素） and dopamine（多巴胺） **, blunted（钝的，不锋利的；生硬的） circadian（昼夜节奏的） rhythms,** or ~~speficity~~ **specific** changes in the **REM** and slow**-wave** ~~ways~~ parts **of your** sleep cycle and ~~homo~~ **hormone abnormalities,**  such as high **crotisol** and deregulation of **thyroid hormones**（甲状腺激素）.

But neuralscientist**s still don't** have a complete **picture** of **what** causes ~~of~~ depression, it seems to have to do with a complex interaction between genes and environment. But we don't have a ~~diagnose~~ **diagnostic** tool that can accurately predict where or when it ~~would~~ **will** show up.

And because ~~of~~ depression symptoms are **intangible**（难以捉摸的, 难以理解的, 无法确定的）, it is hard to know who might look~~ed~~ fine but actually struggling. According to the **National Institute of Mental Health** ~~into health~~, it takes **the** average ~~per~~ person suffering with **a** mental illness over 10 years to ask for help. But there are very effective teatments, medication**s** and therapy~~,~~ **complement** each other~~, the~~ **to** boost ~~bring~~ **chemicals** . In **extreme** cases, ~~electrical~~ **electroconvulsive**（电惊厥的,电休克的） therapy**,** which is like **a** control**ed** ~~and bring~~ **seizure（夺取；捕获；没收） in the patient's brain** , it is also very helpful. Other pro**missing** treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation（经颅磁刺激）, are being investigated **,** too.

So if you know someone struggling with depression, encourage them, **gently** ~~Ja~~, to seek out **some of these** ~~this~~ options, you might ~~be~~ **even** offer~~ed~~ to help with **specific** task, like looking up ~~therapy~~ **therapists** in the area, or making a list of questions to ask a doctor. To someone with depression, ~~this~~ **these** first step**s** ~~to~~ **can seem insurmountable（不可逾越的）.**~~,~~ **I**f they feel guilty or ashamed, point out ~~the~~ **that** depression is a medical condition, just like ~~asoma~~ **asthma** or ~~that~~ **diabetes.** ~~,~~ **It's not a** weakness or a person**ality trait,** and they should**n't** ~~explain~~ **expect** themsleves to just get over ~~them~~ **it** ~~, any themselves~~ **anymore than they could will themselves** to get over a broken arm. If you ~~have to express~~ **haven't experienced** depression ~~to~~ yourself, avoid ~~to~~ comparing **it to times** ~~your~~ **you've felt** ~~feel~~ down, comparing what they**'re** ~~expressing~~ **experiencing** to normal**,** temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty **f**or struggling. Even just talking about depression openly can help. For example, research~~er~~ **shows** ~~said they asked~~ **that asking** someone about ~~suicide~~ **suicidal thoughts** ~~or faults~~ actually reduce**s** their suicide risk. Open conversation**s** about mental illness help **erode stigma** ~~you~~ and make it easier for people to ask for help, and the more patient**s seek treatment** ~~to desecret them then~~ **the** more scientists ~~would~~ **will** learn~~ed~~ about depression, and the better treatments ~~would~~ **will** get.
